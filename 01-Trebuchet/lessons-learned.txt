Lessons I've Learned:
- Regular Expressions elements:
 / = indicates that beginning and the end of the pattern;
 \d = matches digits;
 () = grouping;
 (?=) = this one was a tricky. It pratically helped me find the overlapping strings. The tricky part is that it returns a 2D array and the matches are stored in the second one, different when the lookahead is not used, so the index references were changed from Part 1 to Part 2;
 | = behaves line an OR operation.

PHP methods:
 is_numeric = checks if a string is a digit;
 preg_quote = in combination to the array_map, it helped turn the key values of the number array to literal strings.
